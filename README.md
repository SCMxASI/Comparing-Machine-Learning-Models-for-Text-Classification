# Comparing-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Text-Classification

OVERVIEW : "This code is a Python script that performs text classification on the 20 Newsgroups dataset using various machine learning models. The script loads the dataset, preprocesses the text data, trains and evaluates multiple models, and compares their performance."
